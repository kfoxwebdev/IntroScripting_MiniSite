        <h1>Worlds of Fun</h1>

        <p>This is the largest of the 3 parks, and it also features the tallest roller coaster in the area (205 feet!), and it has a large water-park attached too. At 205 miles from Wichita, the drive takes about 3 hours. It's possible to visit the park in a day-trip. However, it may be preferable to stay overnight if you want to avoid the 3 hour return-drive after a long day of thrills and chills. Additionally, it's located in Kansas City which has a lot of fun options for shopping, dining, museums, entertainment, and more. Worlds of fun is loosely themed after Jules Verne's "Around the World in Eighty Days." Various sections of the park are themed after different continents, including Europe, Asia, Africa, and "Americana" (yet another old-western theme). The themeing is mostly superficial, but the park's real attractions are, well, the attractions. Check out the list below to see what I mean.</p>
