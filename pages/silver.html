        <h1>Silver Dollar City</h1>

        <p>The second largest park in the area is also one of the most unique. At 285 miles from Wichita, it's about a 5 hour drive. You'll probably want to stay overnight, or possibly 2 nights if you don't want to make the drive on the same day that you visit the park. Located in the sprawling forested hills of the Ozarks, Silver Dollar City is one of the most naturally beautiful parks around. What's more, the park features a huge natural wonder, Marvel Cave. They even offer walking cave tours at no extra charge! The park has an old western theme, and there are many things to do besides the rides. These include gift shops, live shows, demonstrations of glass blowing, blacksmithing, taffy pulling, and several <span class="italic">amazing</span> restaurants and snack venues.</p>
