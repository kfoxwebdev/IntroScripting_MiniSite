        <h1>Frontier City</h1>

        <p>This park is the smallest of the three, but not to be overlooked! At 151 miles from Wichita, the drive is roughly 2 hours. This makes it a good option for a day trip if you don't want to book a hotel. It has 4 roller coasters nested into a small landscape with an old western theme. It's located just off of Interstate 135, making the park easy and convenient to reach (you literally get on the highway in Wichita, and don't take any exits until you are <span class="italic">at</span> the park). Although none of the coasters are huge, it's still got enough fun rides and even a few mid-size thrills. This makes the park a great option for families of all ages, and it's worth a visit if you're in the area.</p>
